CinePerc CORE is part of the CinePerc series, which also includes CinePerc PRO, CinePerc EPIC and CinePerc AUX. Each of these libraries offers different types of percussion sounds and features, but CinePerc CORE is the foundation of the series. It contains over 60 GB of samples, covering everything from timpani, snare drums, bass drums, cymbals, gongs, bells, chimes, toms, ethnic drums, shakers, tambourines and more.
 
One of the main advantages of CinePerc CORE is that it runs on Kontakt 5.8.1 or higher, which means you can use it with any DAW that supports VST, AU or AAX plugins. You can also use it with the free Kontakt Player if you don't own the full version of Kontakt. The library has a user-friendly interface that lets you adjust various parameters such as volume, pan, tuning, reverb, EQ and more. You can also switch between different microphone positions and articulations with ease.
 
CinePerc CORE also comes with a powerful mixer that allows you to create custom mixes of the different percussion sections. You can adjust the levels, panning, effects and routing of each section independently, or use the master fader to control the overall mix. You can also save and load your own presets for quick access.
 
Another feature that sets CinePerc CORE apart from other percussion libraries is the inclusion of a MIDI groove player. This is a tool that lets you play along with pre-recorded MIDI grooves that match the tempo and style of your project. You can choose from hundreds of grooves in different genres and categories, or create your own using the built-in editor. You can also drag and drop the MIDI files into your DAW for further editing.
 
CinePerc CORE is a library that can suit any musical genre or project that requires high-quality percussion sounds. Whether you are composing for film, TV, games, trailers or pop music, you will find something useful in this library. You can buy CinePerc CORE as a standalone product or as part of the CinePerc bundle that includes all four libraries in the series.
 
If you want to hear some examples of what CinePerc CORE can do, you can listen to some demos on SoundCloud or watch some videos on YouTube. You can also download some free patches from the Cinesamples website to try it out for yourself.

## What do users say about CinePerc CORE?
 
One way to evaluate a product is to read what other users have to say about it. CinePerc CORE has received many positive reviews from composers and producers who have used it in their projects. Here are some of the comments that can be found on various forums and websites:
 
- "CinePerc is the king of conventional/orchestral percussion. It's pricey though, so I would wait for a sale."[^1^]
- "I still think CinePerc is one of the best recorded percussion library available, Dennis Sands did a great job. No matter how old, a good recorded library (especially percussion) will always sound good."[^2^]
- "Definitely my go-to percussion library for orchestral cinematic music. The Hollywood flavour and room ambience is unmatched, in my opinion."[^3^]
- "I've been using Rhapsody for orchestral perc and it's been great, but I think the CinePerc sound might be more of what I'm after. One thing Rhapsody has is the ability to control a cymbal roll via mod wheel - and I \*love\* this feature because it lets me control the speed of a cresc."[^4^]

As you can see, most users are very satisfied with CinePerc CORE and its sound quality, versatility and realism. Of course, no library is perfect and some users may have different preferences or expectations, but overall, CinePerc CORE seems to be a well-received and well-regarded product.
